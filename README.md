# Project Overview

Retail Return Behavior Study is a Data Analytics project focused on understanding product return patterns in retail businesses.

Retail companies experience significant losses due to frequent product returns. However, the key drivers behind these returns such as product category, customer behavior, pricing patterns, and seasonal trends are often unclear.

This project analyzes retail transactional data to uncover patterns, identify high-return products, segment customers, and generate actionable business insights.

The ultimate goal is to help retailers:

1. Reduce unnecessary product returns

2. Improve inventory planning

3. Optimize return policies

4. Enhance operational efficiency

# Project Information

Students: Vaishnavi, Md. Farhan Prawez

Roll Numbers: 25100010700039, 251810700049

Year & Section: 2025 & Sem 2A

Project Type: Data Analytics

Mentor: Mr. Navneet Sir

Duration: 9 Weeks

# Problem Statement

Retail businesses face substantial revenue loss due to product returns. Without proper analysis, it is difficult to determine:

1. Which products are returned most frequently

2. Which customers contribute heavily to returns

3. Whether returns are seasonal or time-dependent

4. How pricing and quantity influence return rates

This project aims to analyze retail transaction data to:

1. Identify return patterns

2. Detect high-return products and categories

3. Segment customers based on return behavior

4. Provide data-driven recommendations

# Why This Project Matters

Product returns directly impact:

1. Revenue and profit margins

2. Inventory management efficiency

3. Logistics and operational costs

4. Customer satisfaction

By understanding return behavior, retailers can improve forecasting accuracy, refine return policies, and make data-backed strategic decisions.

Primary Beneficiaries:
Retail companies, operations teams, business analysts, and decision-makers.
