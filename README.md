# Retail Return Behavior Study

# Project Overview

Retail Return Behavior Study is a Data Analytics project aimed at understanding product return patterns in retail businesses. The project analyzes transactional data to identify key factors influencing product returns such as product category, customer behavior, pricing, and time trends.

The goal is to generate actionable insights that help retailers reduce unnecessary returns, improve inventory planning, and enhance operational efficiency.

# Problem Statement

Retail businesses face significant revenue loss due to frequent product returns. However, the underlying causes such as customer behavior, product type, pricing, or seasonal trends are often unclear.
